# Stress Classification

This project was done for The University of Washington's Professional Master's Program AI and Healthcare course taught by Dr. Karthik Mohan.

## Introduction

This project I performed data cleaning, different imputation methods, constructed a few different models for comparison and analyzed feature importance for the dataset from this paper: https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/9067

## Dataset



## Data Cleaning



## Imputation

This is a comparison of the F1 score on validation data after implementing different forms of data imputation. For this data I found that median imputation was the most effective.
